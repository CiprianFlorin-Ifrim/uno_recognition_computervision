# uno_recognition_computervision
Computer vision software able to identify UNO cards in images or folders and in real time from camera streams.
Available on GitHub at: https://github.com/CiprianFlorin-Ifrim/uno_recognition_computervision.git

Development Time: 110 Hours

The main code "UNO_computer_vision_MAIN" is able to:
- create datasets
- modify datasets
- create pickle classifier file
- replace picle classifier file
- identify uno cards in images
- identify uno cards in folders and tell accuracy on all cards
- identify uno cards live in real time from the camera stream.
All of this is done through a GUI.
Watching the video available in ./_tests_completed/demo.mp4 is recommended to understand how the code works and how to use the interface.

LIMITATIONS: 
- The MAIN code is able to identify ANY COLOURED UNO cards and ANY SHAPE from an image or folder. 
  As long as the card is placed on a surface that does not have extra objects around (the countour would have to be manually changed).
  
- The MAIN/CAMERA code is able to identify ANY SHAPE and BLUE/RED/YELLOW/GREEN colours live in real time from the camera stream. 
  Multiple cards can be identified at the same time.
  BOTH THE CAMERA AND MAIN CODE can recognise images that are both in vertical and horizontal, as well as flipped.
  The code is able to indentify ALL CARDS with a BUSY ENVIRONMENT/BACKGROUND(MANY OBJECTS), but if they are coloured red,yellow,green,blue they should not be close to the camera or big in size.
  The code is able to identify BLACK CARDS as well, however no other black objects should be present in the frame.
  NOTE: In the interface there is a slider called "SENSITIVITY" this should be used depending on the camera is the cards are not detected, or are detected too easily (too many contours for 1 card)
        In the CAMERA code the same process can be done by changing the "area_sensitivity = 8000" on line 6, 3rd cell.
		IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL CAMERAS HAVE DIFFERENT FOVs & HSV RANGES. SO MANUAL HSV ALTERATIONS MAY BE NEEDED!
  
- The PYTESSERACT code has been reverted to version 0.6 prior to the introduction of skip/reverse/plus2 cards, and is able to identify accurately digit uno cards from an image.
  Can reach 100% accuracy with vertical/horizontal images.
  Has low accuracy with flipped images compared to what it is expecting.
 
The software is divided into 3 sections:
	- Image UNO shape and colour recognition using Pytesseract;
	- Dataset creation/modification, classifier pickle file training/creation, images/folders/camera UNO cards colour+shape identification;
	- Camera file to be used in tandem with the saved classifier (Pickle) to be used as standalone

LIBRARIES USED: OS, TIME, MATH, OPERATOR, CSV, GLOV, CV2, PICKLE, NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, TKINTER, PILLOW, SCIPY, SKLEARN, WEBCOLOURS
They should all be available with Anaconda Spyder with the exeption of:
		- WEBCOLOURS: conda install -c conda-forge webcolors
        - PYTESSERACT: conda install -c conda-forge pytesseract or pip install pytesseract combined with https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
NOTE: Specify in the Pytesseract notebook where Pytesseract has been installed: example: pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'G:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe'

Version 0.5 (23/11/2021):

	- now the software is "aware" on the orientation of the image and it flips it vertically, horizontaly or both in order to align it to the user origin
		- the flip happens for both the digit extraction image, as well as the user final image for ease of use
- fixed some variable mistakes
- added extra comments

Version 0.3 (22/11/2021):
- fixed a bug related to image rotation (some images would get flipped not rotated)
- fixed a bug with the colour recognition section (some images would be recognized as cyan/navy rather than blue, to fix it I reduced the "accuracy", lighter-darker blue = blue)
